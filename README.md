# Tracking Students

This is a part of the 2023 startup project by a group consisting of four members: Dat Nguyen Tien, Nguyen Truong Phuc, Nguyen Thanh Tu, and Luyen Thanh Binh, under the guidance of Prof. Pham Minh Chuan. The project deals with the issue of managing students during examinations. Specifically, this section of code manages students within the examination room. Its task is to supervise, monitor, and detect any cheating candidates through facial recognition attendance. The detailed code segment is provided below.

Facial recognition is a rapidly developing technology that has attracted much attention in recent years. This technology involves automatically identifying and verifying individuals based on their facial features. It relies on collecting, analyzing, and comparing unique facial characteristics, such as the distance between the eyes and the shape of the nose.

With the use of deep learning algorithms, facial recognition systems have become highly accurate and are applied in various fields, including security, access control, and even on social media platforms. Implementing this system in examinations and education is an essential necessity. This system helps control and identify candidates within the examination room. It extracts facial information and, upon completion, exports it to Excel for cross-referencing when needed
